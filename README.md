# Deutsche-Bank-credit-card-visualization
The purpose of this report is to identify and describe the risk profiles of credit card customers within a large German bank, focusing on the impact of age and existing credit on the risk levels. The findings are based on the analysis of customer data visualizations, with emphasis on the age distribution of credit worthiness, job status in relation to credit duration, the relationship between loan amount and duration, and the credit history categorized by age. This report guides the management team in making informed decisions about credit risk management and proposes strategic approaches to minimize risk exposure while optimizing customer acquisition and retention.

The primary business objectives are to refine the bank's credit risk assessment by understanding customer risk profiles and to develop strategies that cater to different age demographics and job statuses while mitigating potential credit losses. The bank aims to leverage data analytics to enhance the prediction of 'good' and 'bad' credit outcomes, thereby reducing the risk of default. Effectively managing this risk will enable the bank to maintain a healthy credit portfolio, increase profitability, and ensure regulatory compliance.

# Recommendations 
Credit Policy Adjustment
Revise credit policies to incorporate age-specific risk factors, considering the higher risk associated with customers under 30 and over 65. This could include enhanced credit education for younger customers and tailored credit products for older customers that consider their unique financial situations.

Job Status Risk Weighting
Introduce job status as a weighted factor in the credit scoring model, recognizing the implications of employment type on credit duration and stability.

Financial Behavior Education
Implement financial literacy programs targeted at younger demographics to cultivate responsible credit behavior and mitigate the risk of 'bad' credit outcomes.

Customized Credit Offerings
Develop customized credit offerings that align with the borrowing and repayment patterns revealed by the 'Average Amount per Duration' data. This could involve flexible repayment plans for longer-duration loans or higher loan amounts.

Data-Driven Monitoring
Employ data analytics to continuously monitor and analyze credit history patterns, focusing on timely identification of 'critical accounts' and 'delayed payments' to proactively manage potential defaults.

Credit Lifecycle Management
Establish comprehensive lifecycle management for credit customers, ensuring regular reviews of creditworthiness, particularly as customers transition between age groups or job statuses.
