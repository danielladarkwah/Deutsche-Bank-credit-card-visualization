# Deutsche-Bank-credit-card-visualization
Created a presentation for management for credit card customer profiles by identifying a credit card customer's profile that is more risky or less risky using good or bad as the target variable. The management team indicated special interest in knowing how age impacts the risk profile and how existing credit impacts the risk profiles.
